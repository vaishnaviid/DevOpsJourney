# 📘 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a systematic framework that outlines the steps involved in software development, from idea to deployment and beyond. It ensures that software is delivered **on time**, **within budget**, and with **high quality**.

## 🧭 Why SDLC Matters

- ✅ Promotes a structured and methodical development approach  
- 🛠️ Helps avoid costly mistakes through thorough planning  
- 👥 Enhances collaboration between teams  
- 🧪 Improves quality through defined testing phases  
- 📊 Facilitates better project and resource management

## 🌀 Phases of SDLC

1. **Requirement Gathering and Analysis**  
   Understand and document functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders.  
   **🎯 Goal:** Define scope and clarity.

2. **System Design**  
   Create high-level (HLD) and low-level (LLD) architecture, UI/UX plans, and tech stack decisions.  
   **🎯 Goal:** Blueprint for developers.

3. **Implementation**  
   Actual coding begins based on designs. Components are built and integrated.  
   **🎯 Goal:** Build the functional software.

4. **Testing**  
   Verify the software through unit, integration, system, and UAT testing.  
   **🎯 Goal:** Ensure the product is bug-free and reliable.

5. **Deployment**  
   Software is made live in the production environment.  
   **🎯 Goal:** Make the software accessible to users.

6. **Maintenance and Support**  
   Fix bugs, add enhancements, and keep the software updated post-deployment.  
   **🎯 Goal:** Keep the software running smoothly.

## 🔄 SDLC in DevOps

DevOps enhances SDLC through:

- ⚙️ **CI/CD** (Continuous Integration & Delivery)
- ✅ **Automated Testing**
- 💻 **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- 📈 **Monitoring and Feedback Loops**

DevOps ensures **faster**, **reliable**, and **repeatable** software delivery.

## 📚 SDLC Models

### 1. Waterfall Model – The Traditional Way

A **linear and sequential** model where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.

#### ✅ Pros:
- Simple and easy to manage
- Clearly defined deliverables
- Works well for small, fixed-scope projects

#### ❌ Cons:
- Inflexible to changes
- Late bug detection
- High risk of failure in complex scenarios

---

### 2. Agile Model – The Modern Approach

An **iterative and flexible** model that breaks work into **sprints** (1–4 weeks) with regular feedback and delivery.

#### 🌀 Agile Sprint Cycle:
- **Product Backlog** – Prioritized feature list  
- **Sprint Planning** – Select tasks for the sprint  
- **Sprint Execution** – Develop the selected features  
- **Daily Stand-ups** – Quick daily team sync  
- **Sprint Review & Demo** – Present software for feedback  
- **Sprint Retrospective** – Reflect and improve

#### ✅ Pros:
- High flexibility and adaptability
- Early and continuous delivery
- Frequent client involvement
- Faster issue detection
- Better collaboration

#### ❌ Cons:
- Requires high client involvement
- Difficult to predict timelines
- May lack documentation
- Can become chaotic without discipline

## 🚀 Agile + DevOps = Modern Software Delivery

Agile paved the way for DevOps by emphasizing collaboration, flexibility, and speed. DevOps builds on these principles with automation and streamlined workflows.

Agile is the mindset; DevOps is the practice.

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

Both Waterfall and Agile have their place:
- 🧱 **Waterfall** is suited for structured, unchanging requirements.
- 🚀 **Agile** excels in dynamic, fast-paced environments, making it a perfect fit for **DevOps**.

💡 Throughout my #90DaysOfDevOps challenge, I’ve seen how **Agile fuels innovation**, **DevOps accelerates delivery**, and together they drive real-world impact.
