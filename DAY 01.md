# 🚀 What is DevOps?

**DevOps** stands for **Development and Operations**. It’s a modern approach to software development that combines these two traditionally separate roles into a collaborative, automated, and efficient workflow.

> In simple terms:  
DevOps brings developers (who write code) and operations teams (who deploy and manage software) together to **work as one team**. The result? Faster releases, higher quality, and fewer issues.

## 💼 Types of Teams in a Software Project

A typical software project involves multiple specialized teams working together:

### 1. 📝 Functional Team (Business Analysts)
- Gather requirements from the client
- Understand business goals and needs
- Create the **Functional Design Document (FDD)**
- Explain FDD to developers and testers

### 2. 💻 Development Team
- Analyze requirements
- Create design prototypes
- Write the application code
- Perform **unit testing**
- Merge code (integration)
- Fix bugs

### 3. 🧪 Testing Team
- Understand project requirements
- Create and execute a **test plan**
- Perform **functional testing** and **performance testing**
- Report bugs to developers

### 4. ⚙️ DevOps (Operations) Team
- Build the software from the codebase
- Deploy to test/staging/production environments
- Deliver the app to users or clients
- Automate deployment and monitoring processes

## 🌟 Why is DevOps Important?

### 1. ⏩ Faster Delivery
Automated pipelines allow quicker feature releases and updates.

### 2. 🤝 Better Collaboration
Encourages teamwork between Dev and Ops, avoiding siloed workflows.

### 3. ✅ Higher Quality
With Continuous Integration and Automated Testing, bugs are caught early.

### 4. 🔄 Improved Efficiency
Automation reduces manual work and errors, freeing teams for strategic tasks.

### 5. 📈 Scalability & Flexibility
Ensures systems can grow with your app’s needs without performance issues.

## 🔁 DevOps Lifecycle: The 7 C’s

| Phase                | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Continuous Planning**     | Collaborative planning of features & goals aligning tech with business needs |
| **2. Continuous Development**  | Code is written and versioned using tools like Git/GitHub              |
| **3. Continuous Integration**  | Code from all developers is integrated & tested automatically           |
| **4. Continuous Testing**      | Automated tests run on every change using tools like Selenium, JUnit   |
| **5. Continuous Deployment**   | Code is auto-deployed to staging/production using Jenkins, GitHub Actions |
| **6. Continuous Monitoring**   | Real-time tracking of app/infrastructure using Prometheus, ELK, Grafana |
| **7. Continuous Feedback**     | Logs and user input guide improvements and future planning             |

## 💡 Final Thoughts

DevOps is not just a toolset — it’s a **mindset**. It transforms the way software is built, tested, and delivered. By adopting DevOps practices and following the 7 C’s lifecycle, teams can build better products, faster and more reliably.

Whether you're new to DevOps or looking to strengthen your foundation, understanding these core concepts is a solid starting point. This post is part of my 90 Days of DevOps series, where I document daily learnings, practical tips, and hands-on notes from my journey.
