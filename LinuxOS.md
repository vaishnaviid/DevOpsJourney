# üêß Linux Operating System 

Welcome to my DevOps learning journey! This repository documents my foundational understanding of the **Linux Operating System**‚Äîa crucial part of modern DevOps and cloud environments.

## üìå What is an Operating System?

An **Operating System (OS)** acts as an interface between computer hardware and the user. It manages system resources like memory, processes, hardware devices, and files while enabling user interaction and application execution.

## üß© Components of an Operating System

### 1. Kernel  
The **kernel** is the core of the OS, managing:
- Process and memory handling  
- Device I/O operations  
- File system interactions  

Linux uses a **monolithic kernel**, meaning the entire OS runs in kernel space for performance.

### 2. Shell  
The **shell** is the interface between users and the kernel.
- **Command-Line Shells** (e.g., Bash, Zsh)  
- **Graphical Shells** (e.g., GNOME, KDE)

Commands entered in the terminal are interpreted by the shell.

### 3. File System  
Linux uses a **hierarchical file system**, beginning with the root `/` directory and branching into structured subdirectories.

### 4. System Libraries  
System libraries allow programs to access hardware functions without directly communicating with the kernel.

### 5. System Utilities & Applications  
Essential OS tools that handle system management like file handling, user management, and monitoring.

## Setting Up Linux on AWS EC2

To practice hands-on Linux skills in the cloud:

### Steps:
1. Create an AWS account  
2. Go to **EC2 ‚Üí Launch Instance**  
3. Select **Amazon Linux AMI**  
4. Choose **t2.micro** (Free tier)  
5. Configure security group ‚Üí Enable **port 22 (SSH)**  
6. Download the `.pem` key and launch the instance  

### üîó Connect via SSH:
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@<EC2-Public-IP>
